To use Hugo you need to install Hugo, which is straightforward - the latest releases are available on [their github page](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases). They recommend installing it somewhere in your `PATH` for ease of use. More details available in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/).

## Dependencies

Although there are no hard dependancies for Hugo, most themes require `git` to install.
